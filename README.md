# Fizz_Buzz
Example code for the data science interview question for python. I defined the function Fizz_Buzz. Here is how the function works: 

If the user inputs a value divisible by 3, the output of the function will be Fizz.

If the user inputs a value divisible by 5, the output of the function will be Buzz.

If the user inputs a value that is both divisible by 3 and 5, the output of the function will be Fizz_Buzz.

Any other input the user enters the function will output the input from the user.
